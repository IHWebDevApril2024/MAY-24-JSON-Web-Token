# JWT JSON Web Token

## What is JWT?
JWT is like the key to the hotel room. Once you have signed up, you'll get your key. You can use this key to access your room. 
JWT is a token that is used to authenticate users. It is a string that is sent to the server. 
The server then verifies the token and sends the response back to the client. 
The client can then use this token to access the resources on the server.
